# My Git Shortcuts

## `git-completion.bash`

Autocomplete for git, not a shortcut.

## `git-co`

Checks out a specific branch or the current branch you are in if nothing is passed.

Usage:

    git co
    git co branch_name
    
## `git-delete-remote-branch`

Deletes the passed remote branch, this isn't much of a shortcut, but I can never remember how to do this with push.

Usage:

    git delete-remote-branch branch_name

## `git-fetch-pull` & `git-fp`

Combines fetch all and pull into one command.

Usage:

    git fetch-pull
    git fp

## `git-freshenbranches`

Deletes deletes local stale branches which no longer exist in remote.

Usage:

    git freshenbranches

## `git-ll`

Shows a more verbose version of `git log`, including file changes.

Usage:

    git ll

## `git-mfp`

Checks out master and does a fetch then pull.
